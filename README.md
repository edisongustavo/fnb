Scripts to obtain data from the FNB bank (https://www.fnb.co.za/) website.

# Why?

I got tired of going to the website and downloading the the CSV to import into my personal financing software.
Unfortunately the FNB bank doesn't provide an API to obtain the data I needed.

So I decided to write one myself :)

# How?

Uses chrome to login and navigate the website to obtain the data.

# Example of usage
